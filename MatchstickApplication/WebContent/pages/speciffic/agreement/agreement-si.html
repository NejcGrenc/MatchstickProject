<h2>Goal of the study</h2>
<p>
Research investigations are a source of new scientific knowledge. 
In the scope of this study we aim to investigate how subjects’ knowledge and mental representations, generated through a series of tasks, 
influence transfer and thus affect their problem-solving performance in subsequent tasks. 
To prevent subject's from trying to diving too much into the intricies of this study, 
this is all the information we are going to disclose at the moment.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
You can participate in this study if you are between 20 and 50 years of age. 
Selected age group will be filtered out afterwards, so we encourage you to participate nonetheless for the fun of the experimentation.
</p>

<h2>Suggested preparations</h2>
<p>
The experriments should take between 15 and 40 minutes to complete, averaging around 20 minutes. 
Before you start you should remove all distractions and make yourself as comfortable and relaxed as possible. 
You should try to perform your best during the experiment, but keep in mind to remain calm and relaxed.
</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
Our study is split into two experiments, titled <b>Matchstick experiment</b> and <b>Familiar figures experiment</b>, which can be attempted in any order. 
Before attempting any of them, you will be asked in input some personal data and we urge you to provide real values.
In the familiar-figures experiment, you will be asked to match similar images, and in the matchstick experiment, you will be asked to solve equations build up of matchsticks. 
In the matchstick experiment you will be placed into one of four groups, but you will not be told into which one.
</p>

<h2>Personal data</h2>
<p>
Some personal data will be acquired for the purpose of the experiment and for the purpose of tracking subjects to prevent fraud. 
Experimental data (performance during experiments) and basic personal data [age and sex] will be stored on a secure server accessible only to experimentators. 
Sensitive personal data, such as IP addresses and locations, will be stored in an encrypted fashion. Subjects cannot be tracked even in a remote event of data breach.
Any published data will not contain any personal information. Only aggregated data.
