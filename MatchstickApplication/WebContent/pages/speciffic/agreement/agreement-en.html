<h2>Goal of the study</h2>
<p>
In the scope of this study we aim to investigate how participantsâ€™ knowledge and mental representations, generated through a series of tasks, 
influence transfer and thus affect their problem-solving performance in subsequent tasks. 
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
Persons between 18 and 68 years of age may participate in this study. 
However, if you do not fit into this group, we nonetheless encourage you to participate in the experiments.
</p>

<h2>Suggested preparations</h2>
<p>
The experiments takes between 15 and 40 minutes to complete, averaging around 20 minutes. 
Before you start, you should remove all distractions and make yourself as comfortable and relaxed as possible. 
Try to perform your best during the experiment, but keep in mind to remain calm and relaxed.
</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
Our study is split into two parts, titled <b>"Matchstick experiment"</b> and <b>"Familiar figures experiment"</b>. 
Before attempting any of them, you will be asked in input some personal data and we urge you to provide real values. 
In the familiar-figures experiment, you will be asked to match similar images, and in the matchstick experiment, you will be asked to solve equations build up of matchsticks. 
</p>

<h2>Personal data</h2>
<p>
Experimental data (performance during experiments) and basic personal data [age and sex] will be stored on a secure server accessible only to experimentators. 
Sensitive personal data, such as IP addresses and locations, will be stored in an encrypted fashion. Subjects cannot be tracked even in a remote event of data breach. 
In the event the research is published, the study will not contain any personal data that could lead to the identification of participants.</p>
